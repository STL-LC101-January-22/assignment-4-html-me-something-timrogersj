					<h2>Lumos</h2>
					<p>Lumos is an 8 year old male cat. He let himself into my apartment when he was kitten after he was abandoned at the school across the street from my place at the time. I tried to teach him how to properly "cat" with limited success. He has been with me ever since.</p>

					<h2>Shenanigan</h2>
					<p>Shenanigan is a 7 year old female cat. I got her as a companion for Lumos after she and her littermates were dropped off at my work one day. Lumos tried to teach her how to "cat" to the best of his abilities. She is still working on it.</p>
